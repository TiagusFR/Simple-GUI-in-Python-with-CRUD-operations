# Simple-GUI-in-Python-with-CRUD-operations

Description:
On this project I made my first Graphical User Interface project in Python based on an example found on Stack Overflow.
I wanted to do a complete C.R.U.D. project and this was what I got.


Files: 

The exp.py file is this mentioned example file, that I got to creathe the interfacce. 

The ops.py is my version with some increases that I knew it would nice to implement to make project complete. 


Libraries:

-Tkinter: was enough to make all features as the operations, the grid, and message alerts.

-Sqlite3: as the database. 



Eample was found on this article:
